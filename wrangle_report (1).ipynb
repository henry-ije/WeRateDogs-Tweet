    "- The first one which is the twitter_archive was given to us and was only downloaded and uploaded into our dataframe.  \n",
    "- The \"image_predictions.tsv\" was downloaded programmatically using the request library.\n",
    "- The last data was queried using the twitter API and retweet_count and favorite count were extracted programmatically. A developer account was created to be able to access such informations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessing and cleaning data\n",
    "The three data sets were assessed for quality and tidiness issue. The were assessed using different python built in functions and methods. 8 quality and 2 tidiness issues were gotten and were cleaned. It is necessary to clean our data for easy analysing and visualisation\n",
